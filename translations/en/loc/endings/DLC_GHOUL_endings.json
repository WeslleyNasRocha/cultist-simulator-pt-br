He has raised me by the hand and set me shivering in the world and now I cannot end before my time. I will move among the Long of Noon and beyond, and I will watch the strivings of the Grail-long and the Lantern-long and the fierce long of Fire, and I will keep the bounds that are still kept, and all the while I carry the colours of lost Hours with me like a coal of rosy fire. [Congratulations on a Palest victory. You have wrestled the game to its knees. There are other paths.]",

So now we thrive together in the soft place that fire cannot touch, and I will always be glad, and always. [Congratulations on a Fruitfulness anti-victory. You have wrestled the game to its knees.
