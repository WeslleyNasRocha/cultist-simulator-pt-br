Forge-long? Used to be a Lethean, way way back in the day? That was our friend, too. We only have provisional confirmation of Hokobald's extinction, but no-one's heard from him in three months, and you know how rare it was for him to stay quiet that long. And all that... in just a year. So if you want the best, that's my recommendation. I wouldn't dither. This one is in demand.'</i>\n\n- 'Christmas Market' transcript, Vienna, December 1926",

Since then, life has been very good, although I'll be honest and say I've been starting to get bored. I don't really live anywhere - old habits die hard - but I'm sure you already know that I keep a house in Zurich, among other places. I came here for Christmas. Thought I'd be everyone else for a change. I've been admiring the lights and enjoying the gluhwein. But I just yesterday had an unexpected visitor. Lee, of the Bureau. She's offered me a job. It's a stupid idea, and I told her so. But somehow I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nSo, Percy, I wanted to ask you: is this your doing?</i>",

Visitor says the Wheel still turns in the House of the Moon, and the kinship means they're going to be a Name when the Wheel returns.\n\nI think I might even believe it. I'd heard Duffoure was Antaean too, so that fits. Perhaps he really was Teresa's father, after all. But if the Wheel still turns… I've got some thinking to do.
