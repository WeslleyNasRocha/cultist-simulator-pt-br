Dorothy unconsciously moves in time with the dancers' actions. When I kiss Dorothy, she kisses me back in equal measure. She's breathing heavily as she draws back. 'We'll be different, now,' she says.\n#uqsylvia|Sylvia pops olives into her mouth as she watches the stage, chewing noisily. When she kisses me, she bites my upper lip hard enough to draw blood, and I can taste olives for hours. 'I'll get inside your clothes,' she says hungrily, 'all the way inside.

One could be lost in it; one would not emerge unchanged.\n#uqdorothy|Dorothy insists that the gramophone must play, from the moment we touch to the moment we part. This occasions interruptions. But she makes up for those interruptions, and the memory of the music is woven into the memory of the evening like a bright thread into sateen.\n#uqsylvia|Sylvia snips your clothes off with her scissors, and then she snips her clothes off with her scissors, and then she chooses a location for what you do next. It's not a convenient location.\n#uqleo|Leo is happy to see me - so very happy - so happy sometimes that the shape of it seems visible through his fragile skin. I will trace its shape with my fingers, exalt him, calm him, as we become what we are together.@",
